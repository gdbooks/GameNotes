It would be pretty easy to fill a book up with the topic of animation

* Introduction to math
* Building a renderer
* Vertex Animation (faces)
* Articulated Animation (robots)
* Hard skinned animation (1 weight per vertex)
* Smooth skinned animation (multiple weights per vertex)
* Popular animation formats
  * Vertex - MD2
  * Articulated - ???
  * Hard skinned - Milkshape
  * Soft skinned - MD5 
* Implementing keyframe based animations 
  * And an animator window, a-la unity
* Dual quaternion rotation
* Animation Bending
