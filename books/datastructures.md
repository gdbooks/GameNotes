#Data Structures Book Proposal

* Part 1, implementing data structures
* Part 2, Algorithms
* Part 3, STL Primer

Implementing the basic data structures: vectors, trees, lists, etc is only a small part of using data strutures. I spent an hour designing a recursive algorithm for my pocket-gems quiz and i think i still failed. 

This book will focus on:

* implementing the basic datastructures
* implementing basic algorithms
* real world use of data structures (like a scramble game)
* real world use of algorithms (like what you see on programming tests)
* STL Primer, on both built in data structures and algorithms
