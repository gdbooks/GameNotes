#Shadows

I've always wanted to write a short book on shadows. Part 1 of the book would probably involve setting up some kind of a renderer. Part 2 would revolve around actual 3D shadows. We could add a part 3 for 2D shadows and the such, but that might not be needed.

I want to cover the following shadowing topics

* Blob Shadows
* Planar Projected Shadows
* Stencyl Shadows
* Shadow Mapping
  * All the crazyness that comes along with this one
